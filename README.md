# robot-controller ðŸ¤–

Robot controller using concurrent programming practices made in Java.

## Project Task Description

Design part of a robot controller. The robot has various sensors
which provide input to the controller, and various actuators to which the controller
can provide output. The controller needs to be able to handle the task
workflow (sensing, analysing, actuating) using a concurrent program.
  
## How to run (linux)

1. navigate into the directory
2. `./build.sh`
3. `./run.sh`
  
## Overview

This robot controller simulator will divide the robot into 3 main components:

### Sensor
Tasks are generated by a sensor at a rate which corresponds
to a Poisson distribution with  provided as an input to the program.
In any given second, the probability of producing k tasks will be:

$P(k\ tasks\ in\ 1sec\ interval) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!}$

Tasks contain two variables: c, a single real-valued number corresponding to the complexity
of the task (0.1 ï£¿ c ï£¿ 0.5), and id which is a unique identifier of the
task (incremented each time a new task is created).

### Analyser
The analysis step â€˜analysesâ€™ the incoming tasks, producing
results to pass to the actuators. This analysis takes the same amount of time
as the complexity of the task `c`.
Finally, the analysis produces a â€˜resultâ€™ which is sent to the â€˜actuateâ€™
step. The result contains the id and c from the original task, along with
the outcome of the analysis Y, which can be calculated using the following
formula:

$\mathbb{Y} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{c}}$

### Actuator
The actuator step accepts the result of the analysis, and uses the
result to move the robot by updating a floating-point variable called â€˜positionâ€™
(0 <= position <= 1). Once the robotâ€™s position reaches 1.0 or 0.0, it will turn
round and continue back in the other direction (as if there is a wall at each
end). When it reaches the wall, if it still has some distance to travel (image below) then it will continue in the other direction to travel
the correct total distance.
Each time the actuate step processes a result, it logs the details of that action
